let questions: [String: String] = ["10/9/19":"You're a thief, and you've managed to break into the vault of an ancient bank filled with 100 sacks of coins. One of the sacks contains gold coins, while the other 99 are filled with counterfeit gold coins. You cannot tell the difference between the gold coins and the fakes by handling the coins, looking at them, biting them, or testing them.\n\nThe fake coins weigh exactly 1 ounce each, while the real gold coins weigh 1.01 ounces. There is a large scale with enough room for all the sacks in the vault, but as soon as you weigh something it will trigger an alarm, so you can use the scale just once before you must flee the vault.\n\nHow can you figure out which sack of coins contains the real gold by only weighing something on the scale once?\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer", "11/9/19": "Ten Perfectly Rational Pirate Logicians (PRPLs) find 10 (indivisible) gold pieces and wish to distribute the booty among themselves.\nThe pirates each have a unique rank, from the captain on down. The captain puts forth the first plan to divide up the gold, whereupon the pirates (including the captain) vote. If at least half the pirates vote for the plan, it is enacted, and the gold is distributed accordingly. If the plan gets fewer than half the votes, however, the captain is killed, the second-in-command is promoted, and the process starts over. (They’re mutinous, these PRPLs.)\n\nPirates always vote by the following rules, with the earliest rule taking precedence in a conflict:\n\nSelf-preservation: A pirate values his life above all else.\nGreed: A pirate seeks as much gold as possible.\nBloodthirst: Failing a threat to his life or bounty, a pirate always votes to kill.\n\nUnder this system, how do the PRPLs divide up their gold?\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer", "12/9/19": "What has roots as nobody sees,\nIs taller than trees,\nUp, up it goes,\nAnd yet never grows?\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit", "13/9/19": "Voiceless it cries,\nWingless flutters,\nToothless bites,\nMouthless mutters.\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit", "14/9/19": "It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,\nCannot be heard, cannot be smelt.\nIt lies behind stars and under hills,\nAnd empty holes it fills.\nIt comes out first and follows after,\nEnds life, kills laughter.\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit", "15/9/19": "Alive without breath,\nAs cold as death;\nNever thirsty, ever drinking,\nAll in mail never clinking.\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit", "16/9/19": "This thing all things devours;\nBirds, beasts, trees, flowers;\nGnaws iron, bites steel;\nGrinds hard stones to meal;\nSlays king, ruins town,\nand beats mountain down.\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit", "17/9/19":"You find yourself on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe and you start a long journey on foot by walking southeast. After you cross the border into Utah, you keep walking. When you reach the Four Corners Monument, you step diagonally across it into New Mexico. There, you replenish your water supply and walk east for many miles until you cross into Oklahoma. You keep walking east until you reach Tulsa. You rest up for a few days and then head east to Fayetteville, Arkansas. Here, you turn southward and hike the 300 miles to Shreveport, Louisiana. You enjoy a po’boy sandwich and turn back toward the north. You cross back into Arkansas, step into Missouri close to Branson, and then, in Iowa, you pass just a few miles east of Des Moines as you head north. Finally, you decide you’re too tired to go on, so you end your trek at the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota. You’ve just walked through parts of nine states. What do these nine contiguous states have in common that none of the other 41 states share?\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer!\n\nRiddle thanks to Paul Schafer and FiveThirtyEight","18/9/19":"The following set of number pairs refers to some coincidences in American history, spanning the period from the founding of the nation in 1776 to the present.\n\n2, 6\n\n?, ?\n\n9, 23\n\n17, 36\n\n26, 32\n\nWhat number pair should be in the second position?\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer!\n\nRiddle thanks to Al Crouch and FiveThirtyEight","19/9/19": "You’re super rich, and you often joke with your cadre of intelligent friends and family about getting kidnapped. You all agree that if you were ever kidnapped, the evildoers would knock you out so stealthily that you’d never feel the blow. Then, one snowy night, you step out of a restaurant and, just as predicted, never feel the blow.\n\nWhen you stir back into consciousness, it’s night, but it’s not snowy. You find yourself sitting on a beach. The sky is clear, with no moon. In front of you stands a shadowy figure whose face you can’t make out. He throws a blocky rectangular object at your feet. 'That’s a satellite phone,' the figure growls. 'It’s got one minute of battery left in it. Use that to call your people to let ’em know you’re not dead — but not until daylight.' He tosses a paper bag next to the sat phone. 'That’s some sandwiches and water, enough for a few days. That’s salt,' he explains, waving toward the surf. 'If your people pay our ransom,' he continues, 'We’ll come get you. Otherwise, there won’t be any more paper bags. Remember, wait until daylight to make that call.'\n\nHe then turns and climbs into a dinghy in the light surf, starts its outboard motor and zooms away. All this time you’ve been too groggy to do anything but listen. Now you watch as the dinghy disappears into the gloom, its wake a faint wash of phosphorescence that quickly fades. Later, there’s a bare wink of lights at the horizon, presumably the mothership getting underway and leaving.\n\nEven though it’s a moonless night, there’s sufficient starlight to assess your surroundings. Your grogginess is gone and you walk about. You’re on a tiny island, which you estimate is a bit more than a mile by half a mile. There are no trees; it’s all flat sand. You taste the water rolled up by the surf, and it is indeed salt. The air is cool, but not cold. Your wallet, expensive chronometer, keys, cell phone, jewelry and small change are all gone; all you have are the clothes on your back — even your shoes and socks have been taken. The bag contains four sandwiches, all liverwurst with peanut butter on cheap rye bread, and four one-pint bottles of water. No napkins. Your knowledge of astronomy is too weak to try to estimate your location by the stars, but you’re not stupid. Before daybreak, you’ve worked out exactly how you’ll use that minute of time on the satellite phone so that your people, who are also not stupid, will be able to dispatch rescue.\n\nWhat will you say?\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer!\n\nRiddle thanks to Marcus Farbstein and Mark Baird at FiveThirtyEight","20/9/19":"What number comes next?\n\n2\n6\n\n10\n3\n8\n9\n4\n7\n?\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer!\n\nRiddle thanks to Scott O’Neil from FiveThirtyEight","21/9/19":"100 prisoners in jail are standing in a queue facing in one direction. Each prisoner is wearing a hat of color either black or red. A prisoner can see hats of all prisoners in front of him in the queue, but cannot see his hat and hats of prisoners standing behind him.\n\nThe jailer is going to ask color of each prisoner’s hat starting from the last prisoner in queue. If a prisoner tells the correct color, then is saved, otherwise executed. How many prisoners can be saved at most if they are allowed to discuss a strategy before the jailer starts asking colors of their hats.\n\nCheck back tomorrow at midnight for the answer!\n\nRiddle thanks to Google"]
