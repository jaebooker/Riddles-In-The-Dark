var answers: [String: String] = ["6/9/19":"There was no riddle yesterday", "7/9/19":"\n\nAnswer: Label the sacks 1 to 100, and take a number of coins out of each sack equal to the number on the label. So take 1 coin out of the first sack, 2 coins out of the second sack, and so on up to 100. Weigh all these coins together on the scale.\n\nIf all the coins weighed exactly 1 ounce, then you would get 5050 ounces. (You can crank this out on a calculator, or use this math equation to quickly calculate your answer: 100 x 101 / 2 = 5050.) But the gold coins weigh 1.01 ounces. So, if you weigh your pile of coins and get 5050.01 ounces, then the gold coins are in the sack labeled 1. If you get 5050.42 ounces, the gold coins are in the sack labeled 42. If you happen to get 5051 ounces, the gold coins are in the sack labeled 100."]
