var answers: [String: String] = ["6/9/19":"There was no riddle yesterday", "7/9/19": "Riddle: You're a thief, and you've managed to break into the vault of an ancient bank filled with 100 sacks of coins. One of the sacks contains gold coins, while the other 99 are filled with counterfeit gold coins. You cannot tell the difference between the gold coins and the fakes by handling the coins, looking at them, biting them, or testing them.\n\nThe fake coins weigh exactly 1 ounce each, while the real gold coins weigh 1.01 ounces. There is a large scale with enough room for all the sacks in the vault, but as soon as you weigh something it will trigger an alarm, so you can use the scale just once before you must flee the vault.\n\nHow can you figure out which sack of coins contains the real gold by only weighing something on the scale once?\n\nAnswer: Label the sacks 1 to 100, and take a number of coins out of each sack equal to the number on the label. So take 1 coin out of the first sack, 2 coins out of the second sack, and so on up to 100. Weigh all these coins together on the scale.\n\nIf all the coins weighed exactly 1 ounce, then you would get 5050 ounces. (You can crank this out on a calculator, or use this math equation to quickly calculate your answer: 100 x 101 / 2 = 5050.) But the gold coins weigh 1.01 ounces. So, if you weigh your pile of coins and get 5050.01 ounces, then the gold coins are in the sack labeled 1. If you get 5050.42 ounces, the gold coins are in the sack labeled 42. If you happen to get 5051 ounces, the gold coins are in the sack labeled 100.", "8/9/19": "Riddle: Ten Perfectly Rational Pirate Logicians (PRPLs) find 10 (indivisible) gold pieces and wish to distribute the booty among themselves.\nThe pirates each have a unique rank, from the captain on down. The captain puts forth the first plan to divide up the gold, whereupon the pirates (including the captain) vote. If at least half the pirates vote for the plan, it is enacted, and the gold is distributed accordingly. If the plan gets fewer than half the votes, however, the captain is killed, the second-in-command is promoted, and the process starts over. (They’re mutinous, these PRPLs.)\n\nPirates always vote by the following rules, with the earliest rule taking precedence in a conflict:\n\nSelf-preservation: A pirate values his life above all else.\nGreed: A pirate seeks as much gold as possible.\nBloodthirst: Failing a threat to his life or bounty, a pirate always votes to kill.\n\nUnder this system, how do the PRPLs divide up their gold?\n\nAnswer: So the solution, divided up, starting with yourself, is: 6, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0. See https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/06/pirate-booty-puzzle.html for a full explanation. This one gets pretty complex.", "9/9/19": "Riddle: What has roots as nobody sees,\nIs taller than trees,\nUp, up it goes,\nAnd yet never grows?\n\nAnswer: A Mountain.\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit","10/9/19": "Riddle: Voiceless it cries,\nWingless flutters,\nToothless bites,\nMouthless mutters.\n\nAnswer: Wind.\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit", "11/9/19": "It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,\nCannot be heard, cannot be smelt.\nIt lies behind stars and under hills,\nAnd empty holes it fills.\nIt comes out first and follows after,\nEnds life, kills laughter.\n\nAnswer: Dark\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit", "12/9/19":"Alive without breath,\nAs cold as death;\nNever thirsty, ever drinking,\nAll in mail never clinking.\n\nAnswer: Fish.\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit","13/9/19":"This thing all things devours;\nBirds, beasts, trees, flowers;\nGnaws iron, bites steel;\nGrinds hard stones to meal;\nSlays king, ruins town,\nand beats mountain down.\n\nAnswer: Time.\n\nRiddle taken from The Hobbit","14/9/19":"Riddle: You find yourself on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe and you start a long journey on foot by walking southeast. After you cross the border into Utah, you keep walking. When you reach the Four Corners Monument, you step diagonally across it into New Mexico. There, you replenish your water supply and walk east for many miles until you cross into Oklahoma. You keep walking east until you reach Tulsa. You rest up for a few days and then head east to Fayetteville, Arkansas. Here, you turn southward and hike the 300 miles to Shreveport, Louisiana. You enjoy a po’boy sandwich and turn back toward the north. You cross back into Arkansas, step into Missouri close to Branson, and then, in Iowa, you pass just a few miles east of Des Moines as you head north. Finally, you decide you’re too tired to go on, so you end your trek at the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota. You’ve just walked through parts of nine states. What do these nine contiguous states have in common that none of the other 41 states share?\n\nAnswer: The nine states you visited are the only ones with multiple-word capital cities. Racking your brain back to third-grade social studies, those are: Carson City, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jefferson City, Missouri; Des Moines, Iowa; and St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nRiddle thanks to Paul Schafer and FiveThirtyEight","15/9/19":"Riddle: The following set of number pairs refers to some coincidences in American history, spanning the period from the founding of the nation in 1776 to the present.\n\n2, 6\n\n?, ?\n\n9, 23\n\n17, 36\n\n26, 32\n\nWhat number pair should be in the second position?\n\nAnswer: 41, 43.\n\nThe pairs are the orders of the U.S. presidents who have shared last names. The second president was John Adams and the sixth president was John Quincy Adams. The ninth president was William Henry Harrison and the 23rd president was Benjamin Harrison. And so on. The only such pair missing was the elder and younger George Bush, who were the 41st and 43rd presidents, respectively. That pair comes second because the list is in alphabetical order: Adams, Bush, Harrison, Johnson, Roosevelt.\n\nRiddle thanks to Al Crouch and FiveThirtyEight","16/9/19":"Riddle: You’re super rich, and you often joke with your cadre of intelligent friends and family about getting kidnapped. You all agree that if you were ever kidnapped, the evildoers would knock you out so stealthily that you’d never feel the blow. Then, one snowy night, you step out of a restaurant and, just as predicted, never feel the blow.\n\nWhen you stir back into consciousness, it’s night, but it’s not snowy. You find yourself sitting on a beach. The sky is clear, with no moon. In front of you stands a shadowy figure whose face you can’t make out. He throws a blocky rectangular object at your feet. 'That’s a satellite phone,' the figure growls. 'It’s got one minute of battery left in it. Use that to call your people to let ’em know you’re not dead — but not until daylight.' He tosses a paper bag next to the sat phone. 'That’s some sandwiches and water, enough for a few days. That’s salt,' he explains, waving toward the surf. 'If your people pay our ransom,' he continues, 'We’ll come get you. Otherwise, there won’t be any more paper bags. Remember, wait until daylight to make that call.'\n\nHe then turns and climbs into a dinghy in the light surf, starts its outboard motor and zooms away. All this time you’ve been too groggy to do anything but listen. Now you watch as the dinghy disappears into the gloom, its wake a faint wash of phosphorescence that quickly fades. Later, there’s a bare wink of lights at the horizon, presumably the mothership getting underway and leaving.\n\nEven though it’s a moonless night, there’s sufficient starlight to assess your surroundings. Your grogginess is gone and you walk about. You’re on a tiny island, which you estimate is a bit more than a mile by half a mile. There are no trees; it’s all flat sand. You taste the water rolled up by the surf, and it is indeed salt. The air is cool, but not cold. Your wallet, expensive chronometer, keys, cell phone, jewelry and small change are all gone; all you have are the clothes on your back — even your shoes and socks have been taken. The bag contains four sandwiches, all liverwurst with peanut butter on cheap rye bread, and four one-pint bottles of water. No napkins. Your knowledge of astronomy is too weak to try to estimate your location by the stars, but you’re not stupid. Before daybreak, you’ve worked out exactly how you’ll use that minute of time on the satellite phone so that your people, who are also not stupid, will be able to dispatch rescue.\n\nWhat will you say?\n\nAnswer: You call your people, knowing that what you say will be communicated to the best person to receive it, at exactly daybreak. You tell them, 'I’m OK, it’s precisely sunrise. I’ll call again at sunset.' At exactly sunset, you make the second call, saying, 'It’s exactly sunset, and I’m still OK.' You even have a few seconds left on the battery for contingencies, but none should arise.\n\nYour call at sunrise locates you along the great circle between the poles at the penumbra — the space between shadow and light. You don’t know what time it is, but your people do, so the line of penumbra at that moment constitutes a line of longitude between the poles of globe illumination. Your second call provides a crucial piece of information: how long daylight lasted where you are, which fixes your latitude.\n\nHad you been kidnapped at equinox season, when daylight has the same duration the world over, finding your latitude would be more involved, requiring, for example, finding the ratio between a shadow’s length and the height of a water bottle at noon, and identifying the hemisphere by which side of the bottle the shadow extends from (north or south).\n\nRiddle thanks to Marcus Farbstein and Mark Baird of FiveThirtyEight and answer thanks to Mark Baird"]
